# Modeling-Genetic-Drivers-of-Ferroptosis-Sensitivity-Dependent-on-MPST-gene-modulation-and-expression
This study builds on prior work linking MPST to erastin resistance. Using pan-cancer data, regression and random forest models show that MPST conditionally drives ferroptosis resistance, strongest in AIFM2-high and copy-number–gain contexts, revealing a nonlinear effect modulated by both positive and negative genetic interactions.

## Data

The raw and processed DepMap datasets exceed GitHub’s file size limit.
If you would like to re-run the analyses or explore the scripts, please download the required files from: [Google Drive link]
After downloading, place the files in the following directories within your local project folder:
- `data/raw/` — raw DepMap input datasets  
- `data/processed/` — processed data generated or used by scripts  
- `figures/` — saved plots or visual outputs (if applicable)

Once the data are in place, you can run the analysis scripts in the `scripts/` folder.
