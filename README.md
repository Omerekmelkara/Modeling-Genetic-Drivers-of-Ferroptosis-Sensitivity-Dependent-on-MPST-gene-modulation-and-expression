# Modeling-Genetic-Drivers-of-Ferroptosis-Sensitivity-Dependent-on-MPST-gene-modulation-and-expression
This study builds on prior work linking MPST to erastin resistance. Using pan-cancer data, regression and random forest models show that MPST conditionally drives ferroptosis resistance, strongest in AIFM2-high and copy-number–gain contexts, revealing a nonlinear effect modulated by both positive and negative genetic interactions.
